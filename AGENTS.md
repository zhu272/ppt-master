# AGENTS.md

This file is the project entry point for general AI agents.

**You MUST read [`skills/ppt-master/SKILL.md`](skills/ppt-master/SKILL.md) before any PPT generation task or repo modification.** This repository exists to generate presentations; SKILL.md is the authoritative workflow that owns project creation, role switching, serial execution, quality gates, post-processing, export, and every per-step command. The rest of this file only points to where related material lives — it never substitutes for SKILL.md.

## Project Overview

PPT Master is an AI-driven presentation generation system. Multi-role collaboration (Strategist → Image_Generator → Executor) converts source documents (PDF/DOCX/URL/Markdown) into natively editable PPTX with real PowerPoint shapes (DrawingML).

**Core Pipeline**: `Source Document → Create Project → [Template] → Strategist confirmation stage → [Image_Generator] → Executor Live Preview → Quality Check → Post-processing → Export PPTX`

**Route selection authority**: [`skills/ppt-master/workflows/routing.md`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/routing.md) owns the four top-level artifact routes: Generate PPTX, Create Template, Fill Native PPTX, and Enhance Native PPTX. Child workflows, profiles, stages, and governance documents refine one selected route; they are not competing top-level routes.

- Topic-only requests run the [`topic-research`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/stages/topic-research.md) intake stage before SKILL.md Step 1.
- Raw PPTX template plus new material/topic routes to [`template-fill-pptx`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/template-fill-pptx.md), not the SVG pipeline.
- Raw PPTX cannot be consumed as a Step 3 SVG template; run [`create-template`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/create-template.md) first and return with the generated template workspace root. Never add Master/Layout structure directly to an existing PPTX/SVG; generate new structured SVG pages from the workspace.
- PPTX beautify is a strict 1:1 main-generation [`profile`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/profiles/beautify-pptx.md), not a separate route; any split/merge/drop/reorder uses the default main-pipeline policy.
- Finished PPTX native enhancement uses [`native-enhance-pptx`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/native-enhance-pptx.md) and must not enter SVG regeneration.
- [`visual-review`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/stages/visual-review.md), [`customize-animations`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/stages/customize-animations.md), and [`generate-audio`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/stages/generate-audio.md) are supporting stages; their trigger rules remain explicit/conditional.

## Execution Requirements

- For any `brand`, `layout`, or `deck` workspace creation from PPTX/SVG, images/PDFs, documents/websites, brand assets, direct text, or mixed references, enter [`skills/ppt-master/workflows/create-template.md`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/create-template.md); it keeps the fixed Create Template name and dispatches exactly one of [`create-brand`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/create-template/create-brand.md), [`create-layout`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/create-template/create-layout.md), or [`create-deck`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/create-template/create-deck.md).
- Technical SVG/PPT constraints live in [`skills/ppt-master/references/shared-standards.md`](skills/ppt-master/references/shared-standards.md).
- Canvas choices live in [`skills/ppt-master/references/canvas-formats.md`](skills/ppt-master/references/canvas-formats.md).
- Icon library details live in [`skills/ppt-master/templates/icons/README.md`](skills/ppt-master/templates/icons/README.md).

## Required Conventions

- **Repo-wide style rules** — when editing prompt files under [`skills/ppt-master/references/`](skills/ppt-master/references/), Python under [`skills/ppt-master/scripts/`](skills/ppt-master/scripts/), or any other code/prose in the repo, follow the matching style rule in [`docs/rules/`](docs/rules/).
- **Markdown language consistency** — Markdown files under `skills/ppt-master/workflows/`, `skills/ppt-master/references/`, and `docs/` are currently single-language per directory. New files mirror the language of their siblings; do not mix English scaffolding with Chinese paragraphs (or vice versa) inside one file. Chat replies are unaffected.

## Compatibility Boundary

- This repository is a workflow/skill package, not an app or service scaffold.
- Do NOT assume generic-project conventions like `.worktrees/`, `tests/`, or mandatory branch setup unless the user explicitly requests them.
- On conflict with a generic coding skill, prioritize [`skills/ppt-master/SKILL.md`](skills/ppt-master/SKILL.md) inside this repository.
