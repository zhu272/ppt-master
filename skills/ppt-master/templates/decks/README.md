# Deck Templates

**Deck = a reusable solution for a recurring presentation family.** It owns an
application contract together with presentation identity and reusable page
structure. The application contract states which communication situations the
template serves, which audience outcomes it supports, which narrative/page
roles remain stable, and how starting content should be replaced or retained.
A deck template is not a finished content deck, and `kind: deck` does not mean
“mirror the source PPT”. Its construction mode decides whether the system is
newly authored or materialized from validated source facts.

| Axis | Deck behavior |
|---|---|
| Template kind | `deck`: application contract + integrated identity + structure |
| Creation mode | `standard` / `fidelity` author a new system; `mirror` materializes validated source-package facts into a new workspace |
| Downstream adherence | Strategist selects `strict` or `adaptive` when the package is used |
| PPTX structure | Workspace is `structured`; downstream `mirror` / `layout` use it, while confirmed `style` intentionally retains only visual language and generates `flat` |

The discovery source of truth is [`decks_index.json`](./decks_index.json)
(`deck_id → { summary, canvas_format, page_count, primary_color }`). This README
defines the kind and intentionally does not enumerate installed decks. The
shared kind and workspace model lives in the parent
[`README.md`](../README.md).

Index `summary` values lead with the recurring presentation family and intended
outcome. Visual tone alone is not enough to select a Deck; open its Template
Overview when application fit must be judged in detail.

## Trigger and fusion

Selection is opt-in through an explicit workspace-root path such as
`skills/ppt-master/templates/decks/<deck_id>/`. Supplying a bare ID or reading
the discovery index does not trigger template use. Current packages resolve
`templates/design_spec.md`; a compatible flat-directory current-contract root
may resolve `design_spec.md` directly. Semantic-legacy packages must be replaced
through Create Template rather than upgraded in place. See [`SKILL.md`](../../SKILL.md) Step 3.

A deck path alone supplies the complete reference. When combined with a brand
or layout path, brand replaces the identity segment and layout may replace the
structure segment; the deck remains the source of the application contract.
Before a Layout override is accepted, its page roles and slot capabilities must
support the Deck's required narrative/content roles. Treat an incompatibility
as a fusion conflict instead of retaining an application promise the new
structure cannot satisfy. Fusion never changes the package's stored SVGs in
place.

## `design_spec.md` contract

The spec stores portable metadata plus package-owned application, identity,
and structure rules. It does not repeat generic SVG rules, spacing libraries,
font-ratio bands, or the canonical placeholder table.

# [Template Name] — Design Specification

## I. Template Overview
## II. Color Scheme
## III. Typography                 # omit only when the shared default is used
## IV. Signature Design Elements
## V. Page Roster
## VI. Assets                      # omit when none
## VII. Placeholder Overrides      # omit when none
```

`Template Overview` is an application contract, not a style description. It
must identify the recurring presentation family, intended audiences and
outcomes, delivery/reading assumptions, stable narrative or page roles, and the
reuse boundary between fixed, replaceable, optional, and example-only content.
These values may be broad when the source supports a family of related uses,
but they must be specific enough to judge whether new content fits the Deck.

`Page Roster` must list every SVG and its declared Master/Layout identity, then
state the content policy for that prototype: what role it can play, whether it
is required/optional/repeatable, and which visible content is fixed,
replaceable, or example-only. This policy does not force future presentations
to keep the template's page count or order.

Every additional authored Master represents a distinct reusable design family,
not one Layout or an organizational duplicate.

---

## Structured SVG contract

Every SVG is a complete preview and declares one root Master and Layout.
Master/Layout fixed visuals are direct atoms. Reusable content regions are
top-level slot groups with positive bounds and exactly one compatible carrier;
zero-slot Layouts are valid. `{{...}}` is the authoring vocabulary, while
`data-pptx-placeholder*` is the native reconstruction contract.

`standard` and `fidelity` author new SVGs and a new Master/Layout/slot system.
`mirror` preserves existing source identities, parentage, assignments,
placeholder facts, and supported visuals in a new workspace without semantic
synthesis. Legacy semantic contracts are not upgraded in place; create a new
workspace through [`create-template`](../../workflows/create-template.md). A
flat directory shape alone is not a legacy signal.

## Workspace and creation

```text
<template_workspace>/
├── templates/                # design_spec.md + SVG prototypes
├── images/                   # optional bitmaps; SVG href is ../images/<name>
├── icons/
│   └── imported/             # optional canonical imported vectors
└── exports/                  # review evidence; ignored during template use
    └── <deck_id>_template_preview.pptx
```

Library scope writes `skills/ppt-master/templates/decks/<deck_id>/` and updates
the index. Project scope uses an initialized `projects/<name>/` workspace and
does not register globally. Empty optional directories are omitted.

1. Enter [`workflows/create-template.md`](../../workflows/create-template.md), which dispatches recurring-application output with integrated identity and structure to [`create-deck.md`](../../workflows/create-template/create-deck.md).
2. Validate with `svg_quality_checker.py --template-mode`.
3. Run `template_preview_pptx.py` when review is requested and always when the roster declares multiple Masters.
4. In library scope, register with `register_template.py <id> --kind deck`.

See also [`layouts/`](../layouts/) for structure-only packages and
[`brands/`](../brands/) for identity-only packages.
